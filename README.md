# captive-portal

This is the screen you see before you start browsing at the LisboaJS meetups. Sponsors can name our Wifi network.

We're using a [Beryl Ax router](https://www.gl-inet.com/products/gl-mt3000/) to repeat the signal of the venue network and provide an alternative SSID to our community. This enables our members to connect right away, regardless of the venue. It also creates an opportunity for sponsors to name the our WiFi network.

We're using [Nodogsplash](https://github.com/nodogsplash/nodogsplash) for the captive portal. This repo is essentially a custom HTML page for LisboaJS, implemented on top of Nodogsplash.
